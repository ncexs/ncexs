# 👋 Hi, I'm ncexs

I explore digital systems, fictional interfaces, and creative open-source workflows. My focus is on building experimental tools in the terminal, designing functional scripts, and structuring clean, maintainable projects.

Most of my work centers around command-line environments, automation logic, and lightweight utilities with practical or conceptual value.
